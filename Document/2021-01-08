Today, I started my work by revising all the commands that I've learned in past 3 days of github training. 

After doing the quick revision of Github, I started referring the course of HTML and JS which was shared by Jayashree ma'am yesterday in our Skype group. 
I watched some videos there and brushed up my concepts of HTML which I've studied in web develepement subject in 5th semester.

In the meeting, professor taught us HTML. Specifically, headings, lists, thead and tbody command etc.

So, here I am listing the commands that were taught to us in meeting

LIsts:

1. Unordered lists: 

<ul> tag is used to stard an unordered list. Although, each list item starts with the <li> command

Unordered lists starts with a buller

2. Ordered list

Ordered list starts with <ol> tag. Again, as it is a list item, it will start from <li> tag.
Ordered lists starts from number.


3. <thead>
According to my understanding in the meeting, <thead> tag is used to group header content in HTML table
<thead> element must contain  <tr> tags in it

4.<tbody>


Apart from these commands, I've revised few other HTML commands that I studied in curriculum. Now, I'll sign off and rejoin on 29th as I am 
having my GTU exams.
