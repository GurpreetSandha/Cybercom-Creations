I'm sorry I haven't uploaded documents since previous 4 days.
I was constantly learning how to connect HTML form to database.

Also, due to exams I was not able to focus much on Javascript. Hence, I took more time in learning JS form validation.

I have created forms provided by Akhilesh sir in the group. I am also going to attach the form which I have practiced myself by watching tutorial from Youtube.
