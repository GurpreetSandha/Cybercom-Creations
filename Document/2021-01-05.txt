Today I invested myself completely in knowing about GITHUB

In the morning practice session I reffered the document shared by Jayashree ma'am and followed all the instructions mentioned in it. In between, I got some doubts which I cleared through self study and watching some tutorials. Finally I created respitory named "batman" by following document guidelines and I'll also assign the screenshot of GitBash coding which I've performed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   After referring the document, I had few doubts in my mind like why we are doing this particular thing? What is the use of this command? Many more questions were popping in my head. But it was all solved by Mr. Chirag Nandaniya Sir in the meeting scheduled from 3:00 pm to 4:30 pm. By attending that meeting, I got to know much about Git and its use.      In the meeting, Chirag Sir explained all the queries properly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Also, during the meeting we were informed by Chirag sir and Jayashree ma'am about the procedure to submit our all task. They told all students to create a respitory named "Cybercom" and make 3 folders into that respitory.                                                                                                                                  1.Coding          2.Document              3. Practice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Post meeting, I learned how to create/edit/delete the file or folders into GitHub. Currently, as informed by Jayashree ma'am and Chirag sir, I've created a repository named "Cybercom" and I'm adding my today's work detials into "2021-01-05.txt" file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Apart from that, I've watched some tutorials on GitHub and learned few commands of the same. I'm quite fascinated the way it works and pretty excited to work on it.
