Today I learned many more commands of Git and implemented it. Today was our last day of GitHub training and I can say that now I'm comforatable using Github. 
I would like to mention the list of some commands that I've learned during GitHub training

git init   : Used to create/initilaize a new repository

git add<filename> : Used to add one or more files

git diff : It is used to show difference between commits
        (If  we edit something in the file, then it will show the last change and current change of the file)

git clone: Used to clone a repository into new directory

git push origin <branchname> :It is used to push the branch to remote repository

git push --all origin : It pushes all branches to your remote repository

git push origin <branchname>: It deletes the branch on your remote repository

git commit : It records commit to the repository

git checkout <branchname> : Used to switch from one branch to another

git branch -d <branchname>: Used to delete the branch

I also learned many other commands today. Now looking forward to learn Javascript tommorow
