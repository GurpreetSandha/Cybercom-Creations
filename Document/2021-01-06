Today I explored lot of things about Github. I got to know a lot about Git and it's commands today.                                                                                 Earlier in the day, I performed pull,fetch,push in Git. I had some doubts during learning but I got it cleared by watching some tutorials online and referring some websites.                                                                                                                                                                                            Remaining doubts were cleared by Chirag sir during meeting only. Then, I reffered the document shared in group. In that document, chapterwise explanation was there of GitHub.     I read few topics from that link and implemented it according to my understading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Also, someone in our Trainees group posted a document in which many Git commands were written. I reffered that documents and implemented many commands into my system. So yeah today I got to know much more details about GitHub, it's importance, what tasks can Git perform and all. Looking forward to tommorrow for exploring GitHub more in what will be our last day of training of Github.
