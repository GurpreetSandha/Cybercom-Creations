Post exams, I have started watching Javascript tutorials. 

In this file, I will summarize the concepts which I have learned today from the course provided in our training group.

I've made notes of the course and I would like to write everyting down here :

->Javascript is a light weight, cross platform, object-oriented computer programming language

->Javascript is one of the 3 core technologies of web developement




****Variables in Javascript****

Variable is a container in which we can store a value

Eg: var FirstName='John';
console.log(FirstName);

OUTPUT:
John

**Data Types in JS**
1. Number
Floating point numbers for decimal and integers

2. String:
Sequence of characters, used  for text

3. Boolean:
Logical data type that can be true or false

4. Undefined: 
Data type of a variable that doesn't have a value yet

5. Null:

Also means 'non-existent'

->Javascript has dynamic typing: Data types are automatically assigned to variables

->Variables name must start with alphabets,_,$. It should'nt contain any special symbols

**COMMENTS***
1.Single Line comments:
 They are used to comment a particular single line in editor
 To start single line comments, we use // symbol
 
2. Multi Line comments:
Multiline comments are used to comment out particular piece of come

Multiline comments start with /* and ends with */
The piece of code written between /* and */ will act as comment

** Variable Mutuation and Type Coersion**

var firstName='John';
var age=28;

//Type coersion
console.log(firstName + ' '+age)

var job, isMarried;
job='Teacher';
isMarried=false;

console.log(firstName+ ' is'+ age+' years old'+ job  +'. Is he married?'   +  isMarried )

//Variable mutation
job='Driver';
age='Twenty Eight';

alert(firstName+' is a '+ age + 'years old' +job)

var lastName= prompt("What is his last name?")
