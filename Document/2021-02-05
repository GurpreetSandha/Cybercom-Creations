Today I learned OOP concepts in PHP
PHP programming patterns:
1- Procedural /Core PHP
2- Object Oriented

It is better to use Object Oriented approach as code becomes reusable and code is well organized.
Error rectification is easy in OOP
OOP approach is used for medium or large objects

There are several MVC frameworks which uses OOP concepts of PHP like:
*Laravel
*Zend
*Code Igniter
*Yii

I also studied all the OOP concepts like class, inheritence etc. 
I am going to attact the coding part in practice folder
