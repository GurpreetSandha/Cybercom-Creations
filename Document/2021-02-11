Today I explored Arrays in PHP
->Array is a special variable which can hold more than one value at a time.
->An array is a data structure that stores one or more similar type of values in a single value.

For example: If we want to store 100 numbers, then instead of defining 100 variables, we can define an array of length 100

#Types of Array#
1. Indexed Array
2. Associative Array
3. Multidimensional Array

                                      1.Indexed Array
                                      
PHP index is represented by a number which starts from 0

There are 2 ways to define an PHP Indexed Array

METHOD 1:
$color=array("black","blue","red","orange");

METHOD 2:
$color[0]="black";
$color[1]="blue";
$color[2]="red";
$color[3]="orange";

                                      2.Associative Array
                                 
In Associative array, we can associate name with each array elements using => symbol.

METHOD 1:

$salary=array("Mahesh"=>"50000", "Ramesh"=>"30000", "Krimesh"=>"10000000";

METHOD 2:

$salary["Mahesh"]="50000";
$salary["Ramesh"]="30000";
$salary["Krimesh"]="100000000";

                                     3. Multidimensional Array
                                   
Multidimensional arrays are also known as arrays of arrays.

$emp = array  
  (  
  array(1,"sonoo",400000),  
  array(2,"john",500000),  
  array(3,"rahul",300000)  
  );  
  
  
  
  Practice files I'll upload in practice folder.
