I am really sorry as I was not able to perform well in JS Evaluation exam.

Due to GTU exams, I was lagging behind time in JS. I watched and practiced few videos of JS course provided by Pritee ma'am, but I was not able to complete the course.
Also I started preparing PHP post exams as we were having tasks regularly in PHP and it was completely new for me .

Anyways, no excuses. I take full responsiblity. I'll really work hard for next exam and hope for better performance.

Thankyou Cybercom
